# Answering Business questions about a digital music store

The [Chinook database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store. The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. 
    
In this project we will answer three questions. 

- Select new albuns in a list to add to the platafform. 
- Analyzing employee's sale performance. 
- Analyzing sales by country.
